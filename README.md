# Flask practise

## Description
This site was my first introduction to flask I followed the code institute follow long videos when making the Oakenshield and company website Which will allow people to contact the company and a page labelled about which gives information on each party member about At this stage the videos stop any additional information on home or career pages will have been added by me for additional practise.

## Features
- **Home Page:** Brief introduction to the company (future plans to include more dynamic content such as previous adventures or the company's goals).
- **About Page:** Detailed descriptions of each party member, accessible through dynamic links that generate individual pages for characters like Thorin Oakenshield, Kili, Fili, and others.
- **Contact Page:** Allows users to send messages to the company, simulating a contact functionality using Flask forms.
- **Careers Page:** (Planned) Will list potential job openings and required skills, enhancing the fictional setting with interactive elements.

The primary motivation behind this project was to practice Flask development skills by building an interactive website set in a fantasy universe. It serves as both a learning tool and a creative exploration of a beloved literary world.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for responsive design), JavaScript
- **Data Handling:** JSON for storing character data
